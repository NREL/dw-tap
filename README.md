# TAP's core functionality package

## Getting Started

Create conda environment (if it hasn't been created previously): `conda env create -f environment.yml`

If the environemnt has been created, activate it: `conda activate dw-tap`

Install the package (from inside the repo's main directory): `python setup.py install`. 

The last step will need to run only once for the created/activated environment (or every time the code inside the package is modified). Next time you activate the enironment, this package should be available.
